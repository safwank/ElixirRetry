  Returns a stream that is the same as `delays` except that the delays never
  exceed `max`. This allow capping the delay between attempts to some max value.

  Returns a delay stream that is the same as `delays` except it limits the total
  life span of the stream to `time_budget`. This calculation takes the execution
  time of the block being retried into account.

  The execution of the code within the block will not be interrupted, so
  the total time of execution may run over the `time_budget` depending on how
  long a single try will take.

  Example

      retry with: exponential_backoff() |> expiry(1_000) do
        # ...

  Produces a delay stream that ends after 1 second has elapsed since its
  creation.
